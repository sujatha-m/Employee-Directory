## User Story
```
* As a user, 
* I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property
```

## Description
Primary goal of app is to use React for the first time. The app takes in a set of random employees from the API Random User Generator (randomuser.me). It stores the random employees in context. The employees are mapped over and displayed in a table format. 

### features
The WebApp complies to following features. These are as follows -

* The user is able to search by the users first name with the search input.

* The user is able to sort the employees by first name or age by clicking on either of these options in the sort by dropdown menu.

* The user is also able to filter the employees by gender by clicking on either male or female options in the filter by dropdown menu.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
This app utilizes an API to populate random users and then create a directory. Other users on the app can search for employees by "name" and also organize each field (Name, Email, Age, Phone, Gender and Country). The names are always sorted in ascending order
